			<p>Bert Mendez was raised in Big Spring, Texas, a very small town in West Texas. After graduating from high school, he made the move to Austin, Texas in the pursuit of a better life and promising future. Bert spent ten years working in customer service, learning the importance of team work and customer satisfaction. During the last two years of his customer service career, he felt  the need to challenge himself. Bert began to work for a local restaurant where  he learned the operation and management of the business. With this new valuable experience, he became part owner and COO of a new venture: Jardin Corona Inc. Over the course of the next six years his business grew successfully to 4 loacations and earned several local recognitions. The success drew the attention of a local investor. After closing on the sale of his business and finding himself with time on his hands, he looked for a new endeavor where he could apply his customer service and entrepreneurial spirit. He researched  and learned the Mortgage industry where for the past fourteen years he has made successful  strides  working his  way from entry level to a licensed Sr. Loan Processors / Loan Officer. He currently lives in Austin with his husband where he enjoys carpentry, works on  home projects and travels the world.
